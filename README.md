# Weather-App


## Description
A simple weather app that provides a 5 day weather forecast for your desired city.  The cities are saved locally so that you can click on them for convenience instead of having the user type in their favorite cities every time.  This project was built to gain experience using 3rd-party web API's.  I utilized the OpenWeatherMap API and dayjs in the javascript in order to retrieve the weather data, and I used bootstrap for the webpage layout.  It was my first time using all of these API's but this project has made me realize just how powerful these tools are.  

## Usage

Simply type in the name of a city you would like to retrieve the weather for.  Click on any of the cities that are saved on the side of the page to get quick access to the weather information.  

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

## Future Goals

- I need to find a way to validate that a city exists before it is added to the side bar. 
- Provide additional verification for cities that share a name with other cities
- Provide more weather information than what is currently available
